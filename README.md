# Whatsapp Audio Transcription ChatBot

This is a Whatsapp chatbot coded in Python with the purpose of transcribing the audios that it receives. The use case is whenever someone sends you an audio and you cannot listen to it at the moment (because you are on a meeting, in class, etc.), you just forward the file to the bot and read the transcription.

The repo includes 4 files that are required for the deployment (in this case done in Google Cloud's App Engine). Keep in mind that, besides from deploying the service on GCP, you must also create the chatbot application through the facebook developers platform; You can do so completely for free by creating it as a test application.
